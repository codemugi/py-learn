# py-learn
Simple codes from my python 3 learnings!

Hi coders! I like python and currently taking an extensive "python developer" course. Also, in the process I am getting familiarized with github! #py-learn is my first repository in github! I am using this repository to post simple codes from my python3 learnings and inturn learn to use the github for future endeavours!
